This is my college project of plagiarism detection system using NLP ,Scikit learn and Python
# 📝 Plagiarism Detection System  

A **Plagiarism Detection System** built with Python that checks for text similarity between two inputs and performs **sentiment analysis**.  
The system supports both **plain text input** and **PDF uploads**, with a user-friendly web interface built using **Streamlit**.



## 🚀 Features  

- **Text Similarity Detection**  
  - Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** to measure overlap between two texts.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  - Analyzes overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) using **NLTK's VADER** sentiment analyzer.  
- **PDF Support**  
  - Extracts text from uploaded PDF files (supports both text-based PDFs and previews).  
- **Interactive Web Interface**  
  - Built with **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface with sidebar navigation.  



## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Python** – Core language  
- **scikit-learn** – TF-IDF Vectorizer & Cosine Similarity  
- **NLTK** – Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, Sentiment Analysis  
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** – PDF text extraction  
- **Streamlit** – Web interface
