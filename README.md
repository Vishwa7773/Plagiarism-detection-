# Plagiarism-detection-
This is my college project of plagiarism detection system using NLP ,Scikit learn and Python
# üìù Plagiarism Detection System  

A **Plagiarism Detection System** built with Python that checks for text similarity between two inputs and performs **sentiment analysis**.  
The system supports both **plain text input** and **PDF uploads**, with a user-friendly web interface built using **Streamlit**.



##  Features  

- **Text Similarity Detection**  
  - Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** to measure overlap between two texts.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  - Analyzes overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) using **NLTK's VADER** sentiment analyzer.  
- **PDF Support**  
  - Extracts text from uploaded PDF files (supports both text-based PDFs and previews).  
- **Interactive Web Interface**  
  - Built with **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface with sidebar navigation.  



##  Tech Stack  

- **Python** ‚Äì Core language  
- **scikit-learn** ‚Äì TF-IDF Vectorizer & Cosine Similarity  
- **NLTK** ‚Äì Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal, Sentiment Analysis  
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** ‚Äì PDF text extraction  
- **Streamlit** ‚Äì Web interface  


## Future Improvements

-  Support for Image-based PDFs (OCR extraction)

-  Multi-language support

-  Detailed similarity reports (highlighting matching text)

-  Improved UI/UX design
